Nowadays, due to higher development activities with the massive population growth, the quality and quantity of water have become a sensitive issue, and freshwater will be scanty after a while (Pinto & Maheshwari 2011) Progressively worsening water quality results from rapid industrialization and urban sprawling, degrading the environment. Wastewater from the municipality and industry creates degradation in river quality and crucial global issues (Gonz√°lez et al. 2014). The aquatic systems play an essential role in carrying the pollutants accountable for water contamination (Shrestha & Kazama 2007). These contaminants stabilize with the system's physical, chemical, and biological processes. The pollution level rises when the river assimilation capacity is lower than the pollutants added to the water. The self-assimilation of aquatic systems is a complex phenomenon, including physiochemical and biological reactions";
           return" Blue.AI: In the waterbodies, dissolved oxygen (DO) depletes due to organic pollutants from wastewater. DO and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) indicate the presence of organic substances (Basant et al. 2010). The oxygen-demanding contaminants' natural purification depends on the required oxygen to be concentrated, the oxygen necessary to secure the ecosystem qualities fit for species with designated standards, and the aquatic system's BOD purifying extent, which is assessed by reduction and replenishment of oxygen";

The accumulation of waste and the growth of algal blooms have deteriorated its water quality, making it one of the more polluted water bodies in the city.In contrast, Sanjay Van Lake is relatively cleaner, benefiting from its location within a forested area. The surrounding greenery contributes to better water quality, though it still requires regular monitoring to maintain its condition.Najafgarh Lake, on the other hand, is one of the most polluted lakes in Delhi. Industrial waste, sewage, and encroachments have severely affected the lake, leading to a significant decline in water quality and posing serious environmental and health risks.Naini Lake, situated in Model Town, maintains a moderate level of cleanliness and serves as a recreational spot for locals. However, urban runoff and improper waste disposal continue to threaten its water quality.Finally, Sanjay Lake in East Delhi has been dealing with moderate pollution due to sewage inflow and garbage dumping. Although efforts are being made to restore and clean the lake, the battle against pollution is ongoing.These lakes illustrate the varying degrees of environmental degradation and the continuous efforts required to maintain and restore Delhi's natural water bodies.Bhalswa Lake has struggled with moderate pollution, largely due to its proximity to landfills and waste disposal sites.
